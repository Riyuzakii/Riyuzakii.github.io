I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in CS at Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~moin/). My research focuses on the intersection of Computer Architecture & Systems Security. For the better part of the last year, I've been on the memory lane, working on projects involving memory compression and memory attacks. I'm also interested in X-channel attacks (where X can be covert/side/timing), transient execution attacks and, their defenses at an architectural level.

I completed my undergrad from the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/). At IIT Kanpur, I worked with [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) on cache covert and side-channel attacks. As a rising senior, I also had the opportunity to work as a research intern under the guidance of [Prof. Kanad Basu](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~kanad.basu/) and [Prof. Ramesh Karri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ramesh-karri) at [NYU](https://engineering.nyu.edu/).

Also, I possibly have the best Twitter handle in the computer architecture community, [@IdoCompArch_btw](https://twitter.com/IdoCompArch_btw). Did I mention I use Arch, btw?
